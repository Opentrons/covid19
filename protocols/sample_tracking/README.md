In order to use this feature, you will first have to upload a .csv file to the
`/data/` directory on your robot saved as BATCH.csv—— you can change the batch
ID on line 34. directory on your robot containing the following information for
each well containing sample in the starting labware. An example of this format
is as follows (including headers):

```
sample ID   slot    well
123         1       A1
456         1       B1
...
```

The output .csv map saved as BATCHOUTPUT.csv in the `/data/` diretory is
generated by zipping togther starting sample wells and output sample wells, and
tracing the ID of the output based on the ID of the input. This will vary from
protocol to protocol, but the input wells here are defined on line 60, and the
output wells on line 61.
