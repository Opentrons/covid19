== Before starting

When placing labware on the OT-2's deck:

. Make sure the labware is properly inserted by pressing the corner into the metal springs (pictured below). You should feel a slight click, and the labware should sit completely flat.
. Make sure the labware is inserted the right way around, with well A1 at the top left.

== Initial OT-2 setup

Place the following labware on the OT-2's deck:

Slot 1:: An Opentrons Temperature Module with an Opentrons 96 well aluminum block and an empty, sterile NEST 100 µL PCR plate:

Slots 3 and 6:: A full, sterile rack of Opentrons 200 µL filter tips:

Slot 4:: An Opentrons Magnetic Module with nothing on it:

Slot 11:: An empty NEST 1-well reservoir, for organic liquid waste:

Start pre-cooling the Temperature Module to *6 °C.*

== Sample preparation

. Prepare the **sample well plate.**  The sample well plate is the **NEST 96 deep well plate** that was output from Station A.

Each sample well should already contain a sample, Proteinase K, and internal extraction control RNA, mixed.

. Prepare 3x **14.35 ml Viral DNA/RNA Buffer + MagBinding Beads...**
.. In a sterile 15 mL tube, add **14 ml Viral DNA/RNA Buffer.**
.. Vortex the **MagBinding Beads** in their container.
.. Pipette **0.35 ml vortexed MagBinding Beads** to the 15 mL tube.
.. Repeat for a total of 3x **14.35 ml Viral DNA/RNA Buffer + MagBinding Beads.**

. Wait for the Temperature Module to reach **6 °C.**

. Prepare the **reagent reservoir.**
+
--
CAUTION: This step is time-sensitive. The MagBinding Beads will slowly settle in the Viral DNA/RNA Buffer. Continue quickly until you start the run on the OT-2. Vortex the Viral DNA/RNA Buffer + MagBinding Beads immediately before adding them to the reservoir.

Into a **15 mL NEST 12 well reservoir,** pipette or pour the following reagents:

[horizontal]
Well 1:: **14.76 ml Viral DNA/RNA Buffer + MagBinding Beads**  (2 prepared tubes' worth)
Well 2:: **7.38 ml Viral DNA/RNA Buffer + MagBinding Beads**  (1 prepared tube's worth)
Well 3:: Empty
Well 4:: **13 ml MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 1**
Well 5:: Empty
Well 6:: **13 ml MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 2**
Well 7:: Empty
Well 8:: **13 ml 95-100% ethanol** 
Well 9:: **13 ml 95-100% ethanol**
Well 10:: Empty
Well 11:: Empty
Well 12:: **3 ml nuclease-free water**

== Final OT-2 setup

. Place the **sample well plate** in **slot 4.**

. Place the **reagent reservoir** in **slot 2.**

. Double-check all the labware to make sure it looks correct.
.. Check that labware are inserted the right way around (well A1 at the top-left for the plates, well 1 at the left for the troughs).
.. Check that labware are properly clicked into the deck slots.
.. Check the deck layout.

== Running the OT-2

Run the Station B protocol on the OT-2. The protocol file should be **StationB-24samples-Zymo-20200407.py.**

include::run.adoc[]

Wait for the run to finish.  The output is the **NEST 100 µL PCR plate** sitting on the aluminum block atop the Temperature Module in **slot 1.**
